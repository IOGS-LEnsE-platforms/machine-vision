Machine Learning and first documentation
****************************************

In 2023, during his first year of training, **Alexis CORBILLET** (2025 promotion) worked with five others classmates on the beta version of the machine vision bench. 

They worked on hardware part to develop a sorting system, but also on a software able to interact with users and process images from an IDS sensor to detect the color and the shape of the pieces to sort. Their system was based on Machine Learning algorithm.

The entire documentation of their application was written by Alexis using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ : https://alex6crbt.github.io/Industrial_Vision/

The GitHub repository https://github.com/Alex6Crbt/Industrial_Vision was also developed by Alexis for his own training on GitHub processes. This repository and its documentation served as a basis for setting up this first LEnsE technical repository.

Alexis was helped by **Olivier LEVEQUE**, researcher at ONERA, the French Aerospace Lab.
